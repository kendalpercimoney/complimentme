# Compliment Me
This is a simple android app that compliments the user when a button is pressed.

The compliments are hardcoded into an array, and when the button is pressed, a compliment is selected at random.
It is then shoved into the TextView "answerTV" and a vibration is run for 50ms (only available on newer APIs)
