# Flutter app: compliment me

A simple (tested for android) app that compliments the user when a button is pressed.

The compliments are hardcoded into an array, and when the button is pressed, a compliment is selected at random.
It is then shoved into the TextView "answerTV" and a vibration is run for 50ms
